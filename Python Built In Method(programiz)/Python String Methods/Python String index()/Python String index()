The index() method returns the index of a substring inside the string (if found). If the substring is not found,
it raises an exception.


The syntax of index() method for string is:

str.index(sub[, start[, end]] )







index() Parameters
The index() method takes three parameters:

sub - substring to be searched in the string str.

start and end(optional) - substring is searched within str[start:end]






Return Value from index()

If substring exists inside the string, it returns the lowest index in the string where substring is found.
If substring doesn't exist inside the string, it raises a ValueError exception.
The index() method is similar to find() method for strings.

The only difference is that find() method returns -1 if the substring is not found, whereas index() throws
an exception.
