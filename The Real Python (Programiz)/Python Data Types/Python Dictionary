Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data.
We must know the key to retrieve the value.

In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form key:value.
Key and value can be of any type.



>>> d = {1:'value','key':2}
>>> type(d)
<class 'dict'>



We use key to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around.
