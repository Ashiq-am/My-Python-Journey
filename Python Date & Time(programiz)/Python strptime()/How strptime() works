The strptime() class method takes two arguments:

string (that be converted to datetime)
format code
Based on the string and format code used, the method returns its equivalent datetime object.

In the above example:


date_string = "21 June, 2020"
.........

date object = datetime.strptime(date_string,"%d %B, %Y")





Here,

%d - Represents the day of the month. Example: 01, 02, ..., 31
%B - Month's name in full. Example: January, February etc.
%Y - Year in four digits. Example: 2018, 2019 etc.
