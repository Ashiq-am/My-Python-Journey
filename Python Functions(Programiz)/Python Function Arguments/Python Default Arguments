Function arguments can have default values in Python.

We can provide a default value to an argument by using the assignment operator (=). Here is an example.




In this function, the parameter name does not have a default value and is required (mandatory) during a call.

On the other hand, the parameter msg has a default value of "Good morning!".
So, it is optional during a call. If a value is provided, it will overwrite the default value.

Any number of arguments in a function can have a default value. But once we have a default argument,
all the arguments to its right must also have default values.


This means to say, non-default arguments cannot follow default arguments.
For example, if we had defined the function header above as:

def greet(msg = "Good morning!", name):

We would get an error as:

SyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument
