Sometimes we would like to format our output to make it look attractive.
This can be done by using the str.format() method. This method is visible to any string object.



>>> x = 5; y = 10
>>> print('The value of x is {} and y is {}'.format(x,y))
The value of x is 5 and y is 10





Here the curly braces {} are used as placeholders. We can specify the order in which it is printed by using numbers (tuple index).
