The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentation string.
It is used to explain in brief, what a function does.

Although optional, documentation is a good programming practice. Unless you can remember what you had for dinner last week,
always document your code.

In the above example, we have a docstring immediately below the function header.
We generally use triple quotes so that docstring can extend up to multiple lines.
This string is available to us as __doc__ attribute of the function.

For example:



Try running the following into the Python shell to see the output.



>>> print(greet.__doc__)
This function greets to
	the person passed into the
	name parameter
