The hash() method returns the hash value of an object if it has one.

Hash values are just integers which are used to compare dictionary keys during a dictionary
lookup quickly.

Internally, hash() method calls __hash__() method of an object which are set by default for
any object.
We'll look at this later.

The syntax of hash() method is:

hash(object)








hash() Parameters
The hash() method takes a single parameter:

object - the object whose hash value is to be returned (integer, string, float)






Return value from hash()
The hash() method returns the hash value of an object if it has one.

If an object has custom __hash__() method, it truncates the return value to the size of
Py_ssize_t.
