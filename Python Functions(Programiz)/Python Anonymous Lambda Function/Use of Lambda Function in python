We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.

In Python, we generally use it as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes in other functions as arguments).
Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like filter(), map() etc.

Example use with filter()
The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.

The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items for which the function
evaluats to True.

Here is an example use of filter() function to filter out only even numbers from a list.
