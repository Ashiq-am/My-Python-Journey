The sort() method sorts the elements of a given list.

The sort() method sorts the elements of a given list in a specific order - Ascending or Descending.

The syntax of sort() method is:

list.sort(key=..., reverse=...)


Alternatively, you can also use Python's in-built function sorted() for the same purpose.

sorted(list, key=..., reverse=...)



Note: Simplest difference between sort() and sorted() is: sort() doesn't return any value while, sorted()
returns an iterable list.










sort() Parameters

By default, sort() doesn't require any extra parameters. However, it has two optional parameters:

reverse - If true, the sorted list is reversed (or sorted in Descending order)

key - function that serves as a key for the sort comparison










Return value from sort()

sort() method doesn't return any value. Rather, it changes the original list.

If you want the original list, use sorted().
