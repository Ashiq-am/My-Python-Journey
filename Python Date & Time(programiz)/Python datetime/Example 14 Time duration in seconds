You can get the total number of seconds in a timedelta object using total_seconds() method.


from datetime import timedelta

t = timedelta(days = 5, hours = 1, seconds = 33, microseconds = 233423)
print("total seconds =", t.total_seconds())




When you run the program, the output will be:


total seconds = 435633.233423



You can also find sum of two dates and times using + operator.
Also, you can multiply and divide a timedelta object by integers and floats.
