Return Value from isdigit()
The isdigit() returns:

True if all characters in the string are digits.

False if at least one character is not a digit.









A digit is a character that has property value:

Numeric_Type=Digit
Numeric_Type=Decimal

In Python, superscript and subscripts (usually written using unicode) are also considered digit characters.
Hence, if the string contains these characters along with decimal characters, isdigit() returns True.

The roman numerals, currency numerators and fractions (usually written using unicode) are considered numeric characters
but not digits. The isdigit() returns False if the string contains these characters.

To check whether a character is numeric character or not, you can use isnumeric() method.
