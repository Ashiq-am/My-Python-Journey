print("a =", a)

# time(hour, minute and second)
b = time(11, 34, 56)
print("b =", b)

# time(hour, minute and second)
c = time(hour = 11, minute = 34, second = 56)
print("c =", c)

# time(hour, minute, second, microsecond)

When you run the program, the output will be:


a = 00:00:00
b = 11:34:56
c = 11:34:56
d = 11:34:56.234566
