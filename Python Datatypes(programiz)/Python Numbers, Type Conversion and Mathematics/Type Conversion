We can convert one type of number into another. This is also known as coercion.

Operations like addition, subtraction coerce integer to float implicitly (automatically), if one of the operand is float.

>>> 1 + 2.0
3.0

We can see above that 1 (integer) is coerced into 1.0 (float) for addition and the result is also a floating point number.

We can also use built-in functions like int(), float() and complex() to convert between types explicitly.
These function can even convert from strings.

>>> int(2.3)
2
>>> int(-2.8)
-2
>>> float(5)
5.0
>>> complex('3+5j')
(3+5j)

When converting from float to integer, the number gets truncated (integer that is closer to zero).
