The Python iter() function returns an iterator for the given object.

The iter() function creates an object which can be iterated one element at a time.

These objects are useful when coupled with loops like for loop, while loop.



The syntax of the iter() function is:

iter(object, sentinel)





iter() Parameters
The iter() function takes two parameters:

object - object whose iterator has to be created (can be sets, tuples, etc.)

sentinel (optional) - special value that is used to represent the end of a sequence







Return value from iter()

The iter() function returns an iterator object for the given object.

If the user-defined object doesn't implement __iter__(), and __next__() or __getitem()__, the TypeError exception is raised.

If the sentinel parameter is also provided, iter() returns an iterator until the sentinel character isn't found.
