When r or R prefix is used before a regular expression, it means raw string.
For example, '\n' is a new line whereas r'\n' means two characters: a backslash \ followed by n.

Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters.
However, using r prefix makes \ treat as a normal character.
