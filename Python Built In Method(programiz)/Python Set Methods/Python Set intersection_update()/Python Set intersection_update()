The intersection_update() updates the set calling intersection_update() method with the intersection of sets.

The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements which are common to all sets.



The syntax of intersection_update() is:

A.intersection_update(*other_sets)







intersection_update() Parameters
The intersection_update() allows arbitrary number of arguments (sets).

Note: * is not part of the syntax. It is used to indicate that the method allows arbitrary number of arguments.










Return Value from Intersection_update()

This method returns None (meaning, absence of a return value).
It only updates the set calling the intersection_update() method.

Suppose,

result = A.intersection_update(B, C)

When you run the code,

result will be None

A will be equal to the intersection of A, B and C

B remains unchanged

Cremains unchanged
