The callable() method returns True if the object passed appears callable. If not, it returns False.

The syntax of callable() is:

callable(object)







callable() Parameters

The callable() method takes a single argument object.











Return value from callable()

The callable() method returns:

True - if the object appears callable

False - if the object is not callable.

It important to remember that, even if the callable() is True, call to the object may still fail.

However, if the callable() returns False, call to the object will certainly fail.
