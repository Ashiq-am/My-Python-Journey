The exec() method executes the dynamically created program, which is either a string or a code object.

exec() Parameters
The exec() takes three parameters:

object - Either a string or a code object

globals (optional) - a dictionary

locals (optional)- a mapping object. Dictionary is the standard and commonly used mapping type in Python.

Be careful while using exec()

Consider a situation, you are using a Unix system (macOS, Linux etc) and you have imported os module.
The os module provides portable way to use operating system functionalities like: read or write a file.

If you allow users to input a value using exec(input()),
the user may issue commands to change file or even delete all the files using command os.system('rm -rf *').

If you are using exec(input()) in your code, it's a good idea to check which variables and methods the user can use.
You can see which variables and methods are available using dir() method.
