The globals() method returns the dictionary of the current global symbol table.

A symbol table is a data structure maintained by a compiler which contains all necessary information about the program.

These include variable names, methods, classes, etc.

There are mainly two kinds of symbol table.


1.Local symbol table

2.Global symbol table



Local symbol table stores all information related to the local scope of the program,
and is accessed in Python using locals() method.

The local scope could be within a function, within a class, etc.

Likewise, a Global symbol table stores all information related to the global scope of the program,
and is accessed in Python using globals() method.

The global scope contains all functions, variables which are not associated to any class or function.









Syntax of globals()
The globals table dictionary is the dictionary of the current module (inside a function,
this is a module where it is defined, not the module where it is called).


The syntax of globals() method is:

globals()









globals() Parameters
The globals() method doesn't take any parameters.



Return value from globals()
The globals() method returns the dictionary of the current global symbol table.
