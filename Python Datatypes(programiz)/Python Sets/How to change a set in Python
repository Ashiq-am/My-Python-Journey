Sets are mutable. But since they are unordered, indexing have no meaning.

We cannot access or change an element of set using indexing or slicing. Set does not support it.

We can add single element using the add() method and multiple elements using the update() method.
The update() method can take tuples, lists, strings or other sets as its argument. In all cases, duplicates are avoided.
