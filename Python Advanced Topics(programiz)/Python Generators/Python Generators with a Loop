The above example is of less use and we studied it just to get an idea of what was happening in the background.

Normally, generator functions are implemented with a loop having a suitable terminating condition.

Let's take an example of a generator that reverses a string.










In this example, we use range() function to get the index in reverse order using the for loop.

It turns out that this generator function not only works with string, but also with other kind of iterables like list, tuple etc.
