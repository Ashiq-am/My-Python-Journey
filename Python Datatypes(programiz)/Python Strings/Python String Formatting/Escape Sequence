If we want to print a text like -He said, "What's there?"- we can neither use single quote or double quotes.
This will result into SyntaxError as the text itself contains both single and double quotes.



>>> print("He said, "What's there?"")
...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> print('He said, "What's there?"')
...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
One way to get around this problem is to use triple quotes. Alternatively, we can use escape sequences.



An escape sequence starts with a backslash and is interpreted differently. If we use single quote to represent a string,
all the single quotes inside the string must be escaped. Similar is the case with double quotes.
Here is how it can be done to represent the above text.

>>> print("This is printed\nin two lines")
This is printed
in two lines

>>> print("This is \x48\x45\x58 representation")
This is HEX representation
