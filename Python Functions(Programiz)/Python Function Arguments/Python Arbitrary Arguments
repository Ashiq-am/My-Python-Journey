Sometimes, we do not know in advance the number of arguments that will be passed into a function.
Python allows us to handle this kind of situation through function calls with arbitrary number of arguments.

In the function definition we use an asterisk (*) before the parameter name to denote this kind of argument. Here is an example.


Output

Hello Monica
Hello Luke
Hello Steve
Hello John
Here, we have called the function with multiple arguments.
These arguments get wrapped up into a tuple before being passed into the function.
Inside the function, we use a for loop to retrieve all the arguments back.
