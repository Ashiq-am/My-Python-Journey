The program below converts a datetime object containing current date and time to different string formats.


from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now() # current date and time

year = now.strftime("%Y")
print("year:", year)

month = now.strftime("%m")
print("month:", month)

day = now.strftime("%d")
print("day:", day)

time = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
print("time:", time)

date_time = now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
print("date and time:",date_time)





When you run the program, the output will something like be:


year: 2018
month: 12
day: 24
time: 04:59:31
date and time: 12/24/2018, 04:59:31



Here, year, day, time and date_time are strings, whereas now is a datetime object.
