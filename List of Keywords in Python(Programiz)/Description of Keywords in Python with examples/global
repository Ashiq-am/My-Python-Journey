global is used to declare that a variable inside the function is global (outside the function).

If we need to read the value of a global variable, it is not necessary to define it as global. This is understood.

If we need to modify the value of a global variable inside a function, then we must declare it with global.
Otherwise a local variable with that name is created.

Following example will help us clarify this.
