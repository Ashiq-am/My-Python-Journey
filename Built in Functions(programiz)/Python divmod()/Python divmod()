he divmod() method takes two numbers and returns a pair of numbers (a tuple) consisting of their quotient and remainder.

The syntax of divmod() is:

divmod(x, y)











divmod() Parameters

The divmod() takes two parameters:

x - a non-complex number (numerator)
y - a non-complex number (denominator)











Return Value from divmod()

The divmod() returns

(q, r) - a pair of numbers (a tuple) consisting of quotient q and remainder r





If x and y are integers, the return value from divmod() is same as (a // b, x % y).

If either x or y is a float, the result is (q, x%y). Here, q is the whole part of the quotient.
