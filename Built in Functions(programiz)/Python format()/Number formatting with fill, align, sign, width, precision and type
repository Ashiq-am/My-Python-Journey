When you run the program, the output will be:

*+1,234

0123.4570


Here, when formatting the integer 1234, we've specified the formatting specifier *<+7,d. Let's get to each option:




* - It is the fill character that fills up the empty spaces after formatting
> - It is the right alignment option that aligns the output string to the right
+ - It is the sign option that forces the number to be signed (having a sign on its left)
7 - It is the width option that forces the number to take a minimum width of 7, other spaces will be filled by fill character
, - It is the thousands operator that places a comma between all thousands.
d - It is the type option that specifies the number is an integer.
