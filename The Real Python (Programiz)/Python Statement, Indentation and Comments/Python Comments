Comments are very important while writing a program.
It describes what's going on inside a program so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.
You might forget the key details of the program you just wrote in a month's time.
So taking time to explain these concepts in form of comments is always fruitful.

In Python, we use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment.

It extends up to the newline character. Comments are for programmers for better understanding of a program.
Python Interpreter ignores comment.
