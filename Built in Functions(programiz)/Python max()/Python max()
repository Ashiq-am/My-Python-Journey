The Python max() function returns the largest item in an iterable.
It can also be used to find the largest item between two or more parameters.

The max() function has two forms:

// to find the largest item in an iterable
max(iterable, *iterables, key, default)

// to find the largest item between two or more objects
max(arg1, arg2, *args, key)
