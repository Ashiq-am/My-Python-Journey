The casefold() method is an aggressive lower() method which convert strings to casefolded strings for caseless matching.

The casefold() method is removes all case distinctions present in a string.
It is used for caseless matching, i.e. ignores cases when comparing.

For example, German lowercase letter ß is equivalent to ss. However,
since ß is already lowercase, lower() method does nothing to it. But, casefold() converts it to ss.
