The built-in format() method returns a formatted representation of the given value controlled by the format specifier.

The format() method is similar to String format method. Internally, both methods call __format__() method of an object.

While, built-in format() method is a low level implementation for formatting an object using __format__() internally,
string format() is a higher level implementation able to perform complex formatting operations on multiple object string as well.

The syntax of format() is:

format(value[, format_spec])










format() Parameters
The format() method takes two parameters:

value - value that needs to be formatted

format_spec - The specification on how the value should be formatted.










The format specifier could be in the format:

[[fill]align][sign][#][0][width][,][.precision][type]

where, the options are

fill        ::=  any character
align       ::=  "<" | ">" | "=" | "^"
sign        ::=  "+" | "-" | " "
width       ::=  integer
precision   ::=  integer
type        ::=  "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "E" | "f" | "F" | "g" | "G" | "n" | "o" | "s" | "x" | "X" | "%"
