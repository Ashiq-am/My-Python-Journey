The index() method searches an element in the list and returns its index.

In simple terms, the index() method finds the given element in a list and returns its position.

If the same element is present more than once, the method returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.


Note: Index in Python starts from 0, not 1.

The syntax of the index() method is:

list.index(element)
