from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now()

current_time = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
print("Current Time =", current_time)



In the above example, we have imported datetime class from the datetime module.
Then, we used now() method to get a datetime object containing current date and time.

Using datetime.strftime() method, we then created a string representing current time.



If you need to create a time object containing current time, you can do something like this.


from datetime import datetime

now = datetime.now().time() # time object

print("now =", now)
print("type(now) =", type(now))
