In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ], separated by commas.

It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).

# empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# list with mixed datatypes
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]


Also, a list can even have another list as an item. This is called nested list.

# nested list
my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
