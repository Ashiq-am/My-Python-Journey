We can import the definitions inside a module to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python.

We use the import keyword to do this. To import our previously defined module example we type the following in the Python prompt.

>>> import example


This does not enter the names of the functions defined in example directly in the current symbol table.
It only enters the module name example there.

Using the module name we can access the function using the dot . operator. For example:


>>> example.add(4,5.5)
9.5


Python has a ton of standard modules available.

You can check out the full list of Python standard modules and what they are for.
These files are in the Lib directory inside the location where you installed Python.

Standard modules can be imported the same way as we import our user-defined modules.

There are various ways to import modules. They are listed as follows.
