A string is a sequence of characters.

A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.

Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary). Even though you may see characters on your screen,
internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0's and 1's.

This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding.
ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encoding used.

In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all
languages and bring uniformity in encoding.
