Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier.
They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

In Python, keywords are case sensitive.

There are 33 keywords in Python 3.7. This number can vary slightly in the course of time.

All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as it is.
The list of all the keywords is given below.



                                                   Keywords in Python

False	                      await	                  else	                   import	                     pass

None	                      break	                 except	                     in	                         raise

True	                      class	                 finally	                 is	                         return

and	                         continue	               for	                   lambda	                      try

as	                           def	                  from	                   nonlocal	                     while

assert	                       del	                 global	                     not	                      with

async	                       elif	                   if	                      or	                      yield





Looking at all the keywords at once and trying to figure out what they mean might be overwhelming.
