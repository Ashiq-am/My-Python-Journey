As stated above, hash() method internally calls __hash__() method.
So, any objects can override the __hash__() for custom hash values.


But for correct hash implementation, __hash__() should always return an integer.
And, both __eq__() and __hash__() methods have to be implemented.

Below are the cases for correct __hash__() override.




                                          Cases for custom hash implementation for objects


__eq__()	                                 __hash__()	                                                 Description

Defined (by default)	                  Defined (by default)	                     If left as is, all objects compare unequal
                                                                                                      (except themselves)

(If mutable) Defined	                  Should not be defined	            Implementation of hashable collection requires key's
                                                                                                hash value be immutable

Not defined	                             Should not be defined	                      If __eq__() isn't defined, __hash__()
                                                                                                 should not be defined.



                                                                      Class instances will not be usable as hashable collection.



Defined	                                      Not defined                            __hash__() implicity set to None

Defined	                                                                  Retain from Parent	__hash__ = <ParentClass>.__hash__




                                                                                 	Doesn't want to hash
