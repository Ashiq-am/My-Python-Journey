Python locals()
The locals() method updates and returns a dictionary of the current local symbol table.

A symbol table is a data structure maintained by a compiler which contains all necessary information about the program.

These include variable names, methods, classes, etc.

There are mainly two kinds of symbol table.

1.Global symbol table

2.Local symbol table



A Global symbol table stores all information related to the global scope of the program, and is accessed in
Python using globals() method.

The global scope contains all functions, variables which are not associated to any class or function.

Likewise, Local symbol table stores all information related to the local scope of the program,
and is accessed in Python using locals() method.

The local scope could be within a function, within a class, etc.
