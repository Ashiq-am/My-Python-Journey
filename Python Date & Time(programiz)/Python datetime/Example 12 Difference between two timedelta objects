from datetime import timedelta

t1 = timedelta(weeks = 2, days = 5, hours = 1, seconds = 33)
t2 = timedelta(days = 4, hours = 11, minutes = 4, seconds = 54)
t3 = t1 - t2

print("t3 =", t3)




When you run the program, the output will be:


t3 = 14 days, 13:55:39



Here, we have created two timedelta objects t1 and t2, and their difference is printed on the screen.
