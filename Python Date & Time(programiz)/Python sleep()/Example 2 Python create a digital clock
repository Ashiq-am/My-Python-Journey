import time

while True:
  localtime = time.localtime()
  result = time.strftime("%I:%M:%S %p", localtime)
  print(result)
  time.sleep(1)



In the above program, we computed and printed the current local time inside the infinite while loop.
Then, the program waits for 1 second. Again, the current local time is computed and printed. This process goes on.

When you run the program, the output will be something like:

02:10:50 PM
02:10:51 PM
02:10:52 PM
02:10:53 PM
02:10:54 PM
... .. ...




Here is a slightly modified better version of the above program.


import time

while True:
  localtime = time.localtime()
  result = time.strftime("%I:%M:%S %p", localtime)
  print(result, end="", flush=True)
  print("\r", end="", flush=True)
  time.sleep(1)
