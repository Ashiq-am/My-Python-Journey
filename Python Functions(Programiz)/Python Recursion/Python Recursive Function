We know that in Python, a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself.
These type of construct are termed as recursive functions.

Following is an example of recursive function to find the factorial of an integer.

Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.
