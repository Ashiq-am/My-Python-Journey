Syntax of if...elif...else :-

if test expression:
    Body of if
elif test expression:
    Body of elif
else:
    Body of else







The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions.

If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.

If all the conditions are False, body of else is executed.

Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.

The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.
