Here, we have defined the function my_addition() which adds two numbers and returns the result.

This is our user-defined function. We could have multiplied the two numbers inside our function (it's all up to us).
But this operation would not be consistent with the name of the function. It would create ambiguity.

It is always a good idea to name functions according to the task they perform.

In the above example, print() is a built-in function in Python.
