The complex() method returns a complex number when real and imaginary parts are provided, or it converts a string to a complex number.

The syntax of complex() is:

complex([real[, imag]])









complex() Parameters
In general, the complex() method takes two parameters:

real - real part. If real is omitted, it defaults to 0.

imag - imaginary part. If imag is omitted, it default to 0.


If the first parameter passed to this method is a string, it will be interpreted as a complex number.
In this case, second parameter shouldn't be passed.









Return Value from complex()
As suggested by the name, the complex() method returns a complex number.

If the string passed to this method is not a valid complex number, ValueError exception is raised.
