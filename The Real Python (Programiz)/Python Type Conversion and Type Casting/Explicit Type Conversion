In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to required data type.
We use the predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.

This type conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (change) the data type of the objects.

Syntax :

(required_datatype)(expression)



Typecasting can be done by assigning the required data type function to the expression.
