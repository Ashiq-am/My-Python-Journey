The eval() method parses the expression passed to this method and runs python expression (code) within the program.

In simple terms, the eval() method runs the python code (which is passed as an argument) within the program.

The syntax of eval() is:

eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)









eval() Parameters

The eval() takes three parameters:

expression - this string as parsed and evaluated as a Python expression

globals (optional) - a dictionary

locals (optional)- a mapping object. Dictionary is the standard and commonly used mapping type in Python.

The use of globals and locals will be discussed later in this article.
