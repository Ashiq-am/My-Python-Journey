The expandtabs() method keeps track of the current cursor position.


The position of first '\t' character in the above program is 3. And, the tabsize is 8 (if argument is not passed).

The expandtabs() character replaces the '\t' with whitespace until the next tab stop.
The position of '\t' is 3 and the first tab stop is 8. Hence, the number of spaces after 'xyz' is 5.

The next tab stops are the multiples of tabsize. The next tab stops are 16, 24, 32 and so on.

Now, the position of second '\t' character is 13. And, the next tab stop is 16. Hence, there are 3 spaces after '12345'.
