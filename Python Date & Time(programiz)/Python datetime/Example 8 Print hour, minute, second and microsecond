Once you create a time object, you can easily print its attributes such as hour, minute etc.


from datetime import time

a = time(11, 34, 56)

print("hour =", a.hour)
print("minute =", a.minute)
print("second =", a.second)
print("microsecond =", a.microsecond)


When you run the example, the output will be:

hour = 11
minute = 34
second = 56
microsecond = 0


Notice that we haven't passed microsecond argument. Hence, its default value 0 is printed.

datetime.datetime
The datetime module has a class named dateclass that can contain information from both date and time objects.
