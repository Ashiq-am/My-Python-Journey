The time.ctime() function takes seconds passed since epoch as an argument and returns a string representing local time.



import time

# seconds passed since epoch
seconds = 1545925769.9618232
local_time = time.ctime(seconds)
print("Local time:", local_time)




If you run the program, the output will be something like:

Local time: Thu Dec 27 15:49:29 2018
