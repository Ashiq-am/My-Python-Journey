from datetime import date

today = date.today()
print("Today's date:", today)



Here, we imported the date class from the datetime module. Then, we used the date.today() method to get the current local date.

By the way, date.today() returns a date object, which is assigned to the today variable in the above program.
Now, you can use the strftime() method to create a string representing date in different formats.
