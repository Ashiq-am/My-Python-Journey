We can get year, month, day, day of the week etc. from the date object easily. Here's how:


from datetime import date

# date object of today's date
today = date.today()

print("Current year:", today.year)
print("Current month:", today.month)
print("Current day:", today.day)



datetime.time
A time object instantiated from the time class represents the local time.
