import datetime

d = datetime.date(2019, 4, 13)
print(d)

When you run the program, the output will be:

2019-04-13

If you are wondering, date() in the above example is a constructor of the date class.
The constructor takes three arguments: year, month and day.

The variable a is a date object.


We can only import date class from the datetime module. Here's how:


from datetime import date

a = date(2019, 4, 13)
print(a)
