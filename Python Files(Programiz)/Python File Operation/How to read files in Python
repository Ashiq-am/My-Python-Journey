To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading mode.

There are various methods available for this purpose. We can use the read(size) method to read in size number of data.
If size parameter is not specified, it reads and returns up to the end of the file.



We can see that, the read() method returns newline as '\n'.
Once the end of file is reached, we get empty string on further reading.

We can change our current file cursor (position) using the seek() method.
Similarly, the tell() method returns our current position (in number of bytes).



The lines in file itself has a newline character '\n'.

Moreover, the print() end parameter to avoid two newlines when printing.

Alternately, we can use readline() method to read individual lines of a file.
This method reads a file till the newline, including the newline character.
