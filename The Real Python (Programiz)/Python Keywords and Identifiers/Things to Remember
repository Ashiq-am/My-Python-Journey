Python is a case-sensitive language. This means, Variable and variable are not the same. Always name identifiers that make sense.

While, c = 10 is valid. Writing count = 10 would make more sense and it would be easier to figure out what it
does even when you look at your code after a long gap.

Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, this_is_a_long_variable.
