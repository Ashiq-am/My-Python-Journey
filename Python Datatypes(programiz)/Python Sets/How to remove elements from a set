A particular item can be removed from set using methods, discard() and remove().

The only difference between the two is that, while using discard() if the item does not exist in the set,
it remains unchanged. But remove() will raise an error in such condition.

The following example will illustrate this.










Similarly, we can remove and return an item using the pop() method.

Set being unordered, there is no way of determining which item will be popped. It is completely arbitrary.

We can also remove all items from a set using clear().
