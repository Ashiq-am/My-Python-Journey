While importing a module, Python looks at several places. Interpreter first looks for
a built-in module then (if not found) into a list of directories defined in sys.path. The search is in this order.

The current directory.
PYTHONPATH (an environment variable with a list of directory).
The installation-dependent default directory.


>>> import sys
>>> sys.path
['',
'C:\\Python33\\Lib\\idlelib',
'C:\\Windows\\system32\\python33.zip',
'C:\\Python33\\DLLs',
'C:\\Python33\\lib',
'C:\\Python33',
'C:\\Python33\\lib\\site-packages']

We can add modify this list to add our own path.
