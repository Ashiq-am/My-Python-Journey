We can generate a sequence of numbers using range() function. range(10) will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers).

We can also define the start, stop and step size as range(start,stop,step size). step size defaults to 1 if not provided.

This function does not store all the values in memory, it would be inefficient.
So it remembers the start, stop, step size and generates the next number on the go.

To force this function to output all the items, we can use the function list().



The following example will clarify this.

# Output: range(0, 10)
print(range(10))

# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(list(range(10)))

# Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(list(range(2, 8)))

# Output: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
print(list(range(2, 20, 3)))








We can use the range() function in for loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers.
It can be combined with the len() function to iterate though a sequence using indexing. Here is an example.
