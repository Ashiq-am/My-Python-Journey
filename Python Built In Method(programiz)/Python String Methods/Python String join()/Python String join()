The join() is a string method which returns a string concatenated with the elements of an iterable.

The join() method provides a flexible way to concatenate string. It concatenates each element of an iterable (such as list,
string and tuple) to the string and returns the concatenated string.

The syntax of join() is:

string.join(iterable)








join() Parameters
The join() method takes an iterable - objects capable of returning its members one at a time

Some of the example of iterables are:

Native datatypes - List, Tuple, String, Dictionary and Set

File objects and objects you define with an __iter__() or __getitem()__ method









Return Value from join()
The join() method returns a string concatenated with the elements of an iterable.

If the iterable contains any non-string values, it raises a TypeError exception.
