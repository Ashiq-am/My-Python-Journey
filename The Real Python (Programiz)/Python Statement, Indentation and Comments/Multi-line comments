If we have comments that extend multiple lines, one way of doing it is to use hash (#) in the beginning of each line. For example:

#This is a long comment
#and it extends
#to multiple lines





Another way of doing this is to use triple quotes, either ''' or """.



These triple quotes are generally used for multi-line strings. But they can be used as multi-line comment as well.
Unless they are not docstrings, they do not generate any extra code.



"""This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments"""
