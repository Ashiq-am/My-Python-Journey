The difference() method returns the set difference of two sets.

If A and B are two sets. The set difference of A and B is a set of elements that exists only in set A but not in B.
For example:

If A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {2, 3, 9}

Then,
A - B = {1, 4}
B - A = {9}






The syntax of difference() method in Python is:

A.difference(B)


Here, A and B are two sets. The following syntax is equivalent to A-B.
