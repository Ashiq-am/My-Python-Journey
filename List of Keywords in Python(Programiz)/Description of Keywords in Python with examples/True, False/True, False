True and False are truth values in Python.
They are the results of comparison operations or logical (Boolean) operations in Python. For example:




>>> 1 == 1
True
>>> 5 > 3
True
>>> True or False
True
>>> 10 <= 1
False
>>> 3 > 7
False
>>> True and False
False






Here we can see that the first three statements are true so the interpreter returns True and returns False for the remaining
three statements. True and False in python is same as 1 and 0. This can be justified with the following example:

>>> True == 1
True
>>> False == 0
True
>>> True + True
