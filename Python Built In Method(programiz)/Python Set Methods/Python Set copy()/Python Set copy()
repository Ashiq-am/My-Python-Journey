The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the set.

A set can be copied using = operator in Python. For example:



numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
new_numbers = numbers






The problem with copying the set in this way is that if you modify the numbers set, the new_numbers set is also modified.








The syntax of copy() is:

set.copy()
