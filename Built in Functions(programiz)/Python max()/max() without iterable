To find the largest object between two or more parameters, we can use this syntax:

max(arg1, arg2, *args, key)







max() parameters

arg1 - an object; can be numbers, strings, etc.

arg2 - an object; can be numbers, strings, etc.

*args (optional) - any number of objects

key (optional) - key function where each argument is passed, and comparison is performed based on its return value

Basically, the max() function finds the largest item between two or more objects.
