The Python set union() method returns a new set with distinct elements from all the sets.

The union of two or more sets is the set of all distinct elements present in all the sets. For example:

A = {1, 2}
B = {2, 3, 4}
C = {5}

Then,
A∪B = B∪A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

A∪C = C∪A = {1, 2, 5}

B∪C = C∪B = {2, 3, 4, 5}

A∪B∪C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}








The syntax of union() is:

A.union(*other_sets)

Note: * is not part of the syntax. It is used to indicate that the method can take 0 or more arguments.










Return Value from union()

The union() method returns a new set with elements from the set and all other sets (passed as an argument).

If the argument is not passed to union(), it returns a shallow copy of the set.
