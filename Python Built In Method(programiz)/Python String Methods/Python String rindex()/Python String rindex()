The rindex() method returns the highest index of the substring inside the string (if found).
If the substring is not found, it raises an exception.

The syntax of rindex() is:

str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]] )









rindex() Parameters
The rindex() method takes three parameters:

sub - substring to be searched in the str string.

start and end(optional) - substring is searched within str[start:end]










Return Value from rindex()

If substring exists inside the string, it returns the highest index in the string where substring is found.

If substring doesn't exist inside the string, it raises a ValueError exception.

The rindex() method is similar to rfind() method for strings.

The only difference is that rfind() returns -1 if the substring is not found, whereas rindex() throws an exception.
