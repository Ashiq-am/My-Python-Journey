The use of nonlocal keyword is very much similar to the global keyword.
nonlocal is used to declare that a variable inside a nested function (function inside a function) is not local to it,
meaning it lies in the outer inclosing function.


If we need to modify the value of a non-local variable inside a nested function, then we must declare it with nonlocal.
Otherwise a local variable with that name is created inside the nested function. Following example will help us clarify this.
