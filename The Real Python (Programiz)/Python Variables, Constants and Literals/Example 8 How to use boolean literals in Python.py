#In the above program, we use boolean literal True and False.
# In Python, True represents the value as 1 and False as 0.
# The value of x is True because 1 is equal to True.
# And, the value of y is False because 1 is not equal to False.
# Similarly, we can use the True and False in numeric expressions as the value.
# The value of a is 5 because we add True which has value of 1 with 4. Similarly, b is 10 because we add the False having value of 0 with 10.
