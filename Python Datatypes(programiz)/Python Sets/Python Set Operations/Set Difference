Difference of A and B (A - B) is a set of elements that are only in A but not in B.
Similarly, B - A is a set of element in B but not in A.

Difference is performed using - operator. Same can be accomplished using the method difference().








Try the following examples on Python shell.


# use difference function on A
>>> A.difference(B)
{1, 2, 3}

# use - operator on B
>>> B - A
{8, 6, 7}

# use difference function on B
>>> B.difference(A)
{8, 6, 7}
