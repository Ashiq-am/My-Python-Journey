The print() function prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.

The full syntax of print() is:


print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)







print() Parameters

objects - object to the printed. * indicates that there may be more than one object

sep - objects are separated by sep. Default value: ' '

end - end is printed at last

file - must be an object with write(string) method. If omitted it, sys.stdout will be used which prints objects on the screen.

flush - If True, the stream is forcibly flushed. Default value: False


Note: sep, end, file and flush are keyword arguments. If you want to use sep argument, you have to use:

print(*objects, sep = 'separator')

not

print(*objects, 'separator')
