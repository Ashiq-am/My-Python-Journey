To find the largest item in an iterable, we use this syntax:


max(iterable, *iterables, key, default)







max() Parameters

iterable - an iterable such as list, tuple, set, dictionary, etc.

*iterables (optional) - any number of iterables; can be more than one

key (optional) - key function where the iterables are passed and comparison is performed based on its return value
