The help() method calls the built-in Python help system.

The syntax of help() is:

help(object)






help() Parameters

The help() method takes maximum of one parameter.

object (optional) - you want to generate the help of the given object









How help() works in Python?

The help() method is used for interactive use.
It's recommenced to try it in your interpreter when you need help to write Python program and use Python modules.





object is passed to help() (not a string)
Try these on Python shell.

>>> help(list)
>>> help(dict)
>>> help(print)
>>> help([1, 2, 3])


If string is passed as an argument, name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic,
and a help page is printed.







string is passed as an argument to help()
If string is passed as an argument, the given string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword,
or documentation topic, and a help page is printed.

Try these on Python shell.

>>> help('random thing')

>>> help('print')

>>> help('def')

>>> from math import *
    help('math.pow')







no argument is passed to help()
If no argument is passed, Python's help utility (interactive help system) starts on the console.

>>> help()

Then, you can enter the name of the topic to get help on writing Python programs and using Python modules. For example:

help> True
help> 'print'
help > print
To quit the help utility and return to the interpreter, you need to type quit and press enter.

help > quit
