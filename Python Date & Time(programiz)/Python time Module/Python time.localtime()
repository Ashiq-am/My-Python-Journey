The localtime() function takes the number of seconds passed since epoch as an argument and returns struct_time in local time.



import time

result = time.localtime(1545925769)
print("result:", result)
print("\nyear:", result.tm_year)
print("tm_hour:", result.tm_hour)




When you run the program, the output will be something like:

result: time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=27, tm_hour=15, tm_min=49, tm_sec=29, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=361, tm_isdst=0)

year: 2018
tm_hour: 15



If no argument or None is passed to localtime(), the value returned by time() is used.
