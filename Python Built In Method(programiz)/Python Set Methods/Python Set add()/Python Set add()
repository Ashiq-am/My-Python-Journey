The set add() method adds a given element to a set. If the element is already present, it doesn't add any element.

The syntax of set add() method is:

set.add(elem)


The add() method doesn't add an element to the set if it's already present in it.


Also, you don't get back a set if you use add() method when creating a set object.

noneValue = set().add(elem)


The above statement doesn't return a reference to the set but 'None',
because the statement returns the return type of add which is 'None',
