In the above example, calc_factorial() is a recursive functions as it calls itself.

When we call this function with a positive integer, it will recursively call itself by decreasing the number.

Each function call multiples the number with the factorial of number 1 until the number is equal to one.
This recursive call can be explained in the following steps.


calc_factorial(4)              # 1st call with 4
4 * calc_factorial(3)          # 2nd call with 3
4 * 3 * calc_factorial(2)      # 3rd call with 2
4 * 3 * 2 * calc_factorial(1)  # 4th call with 1
4 * 3 * 2 * 1                  # return from 4th call as number=1
4 * 3 * 2                      # return from 3rd call
4 * 6                          # return from 2nd call
24                             # return from 1st call



Our recursion ends when the number reduces to 1. This is called the base condition.

Every recursive function must have a base condition that stops the recursion or else the function calls itself infinitely.
