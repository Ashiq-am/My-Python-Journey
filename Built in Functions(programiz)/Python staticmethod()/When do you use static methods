1. Grouping utility function to a class

Static methods have a limited use case because, like class methods or any other methods within a class,
they cannot access the properties of the class itself.

However, when you need a utility function that doesn't access any properties of a
class but makes sense that it belongs to the class, we use static functions.







2. Having a single implementation
Static methods are used when we don't want subclasses of a class change/override a specific implementation of a method.
