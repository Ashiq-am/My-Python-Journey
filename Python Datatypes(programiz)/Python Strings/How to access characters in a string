We can access individual characters using indexing and a range of characters using slicing. Index starts from 0.
Trying to access a character out of index range will raise an IndexError. The index must be an integer.
We can't use float or other types, this will result into TypeError.

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences.

The index of -1 refers to the last item,
-2 to the second last item and so on. We can access a range of items in a string by using the slicing operator (colon).











If we try to access index out of the range or use decimal number, we will get errors.

# index must be in range
>>> my_string[15]
...
IndexError: string index out of range

# index must be an integer
>>> my_string[1.5]
...
TypeError: string indices must be integers
Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below.

If we want to access a range, we need the index that will slice the portion from the string.
