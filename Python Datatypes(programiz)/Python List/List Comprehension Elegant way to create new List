List comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create a new list from an existing list in Python.

List comprehension consists of an expression followed by for statement inside square brackets.

Here is an example to make a list with each item being increasing power of 2.




pow2 = [2 ** x for x in range(10)]

# Output: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
print(pow2)





This code is equivalent to

pow2 = []
for x in range(10):
   pow2.append(2 ** x)



A list comprehension can optionally contain more for or if statements. An optional if statement can filter out items for the new list. Here are some examples.

>>> pow2 = [2 ** x for x in range(10) if x > 5]
>>> pow2
[64, 128, 256, 512]
>>> odd = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 1]
>>> odd
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
>>> [x+y for x in ['Python ','C '] for y in ['Language','Programming']]
['Python Language', 'Python Programming', 'C Language', 'C Programming']
