The async and await keywords are provided by the asyncio library in Python. They are used to write concurrent code in Python.
For example,

import asyncio

async def main():
    print('Hello')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('world')



To run the program, we use

asyncio.run(main())


In the above program, the async keyword specifies that the function will be executed asynchronously.

Here, first Hello is printed. The await keyword makes the program wait for 1 second. And then the world is printed.
