A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that
hold information which cannot be changed later.

Non technically, you can think of constant as a bag to store some books and those books cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag.









Assigning value to a constant in Python

In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned on a module. Here, the module means a new file containing variables,
functions etc which is imported to main file.
Inside the module, constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.
