In order to write into a file in Python, we need to open it in write 'w', append 'a' or exclusive creation 'x' mode.

We need to be careful with the 'w' mode as it will overwrite into the file if it already exists. All previous data are erased.

Writing a string or sequence of bytes (for binary files) is done using write() method.

This method returns the number of characters written to the file.
