The zip() function takes iterables (can be zero or more), aggregates them in a tuple, and return it.

The syntax of the zip() function is:

zip(*iterables)



zip() Parameters

Parameter	                                               Description

iterables	                     can be built-in iterables (like: list, string, dict), or user-defined iterable











Return Value from zip()

The zip()function returns an iterator of tuples based on the iterable objects.

1.If we do not pass any parameter, zip() returns an empty iterator

2.If a single iterable is passed, zip() returns an iterator of tuples with each tuple having only one element.

3.If multiple iterables are passed, zip() returns an iterator of tuples with each tuple having elements from all the iterables.


Suppose, two iterables are passed to zip(); one iterable containing three and other containing five elements.
Then, the returned iterator will contain three tuples. It's because iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.
