If you want your own implementation for sorting, sort() also accepts a key function as an optional parameter.

Based on the results of the key function, you can sort the given list.

list.sort(key=len)


Alternatively for sorted

sorted(list, key=len)



Here, len is the Python's in-built function to count the length of an element.

The list is sorted based on the length of its each element, from lowest count to highest.
