In Python programming, exceptions are raised when corresponding errors occur at run time,
but we can forcefully raise it using the keyword raise.

We can also optionally pass in value to the exception to clarify why that exception was raised.





>>> raise KeyboardInterrupt
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyboardInterrupt

>>> raise MemoryError("This is an argument")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
MemoryError: This is an argument

>>> try:
...     a = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
...     if a <= 0:
...         raise ValueError("That is not a positive number!")
... except ValueError as ve:
...     print(ve)
...
Enter a positive integer: -2
That is not a positive number!
