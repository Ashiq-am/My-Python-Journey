The intersection() method returns a new set with elements that are common to all sets.

The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements which are common to all sets. For example:

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
B = {2, 3, 4,  9}
C = {2, 4, 9 10}

Then,
A∩B = B∩A ={2, 3, 4}
A∩C = C∩A ={2, 4}
B∩C = C∩B ={2, 4, 9}

A∩B∩C = {2, 4}








The syntax of intersection() in Python is:

A.intersection(*other_sets)






intersection() Parameters

The intersection() allows arbitrary number of arguments (sets).

Note: * is not part of the syntax. It is used to indicate that the method allows arbitrary number of arguments.




Return Value from Intersection()

The intersection() method returns the intersection of set A with all the sets (passed as argument).


If argument is not passed to intersection(), it returns a shallow copy the set (A).
