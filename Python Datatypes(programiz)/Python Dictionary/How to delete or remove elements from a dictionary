We can remove a particular item in a dictionary by using the method pop().
This method removes as item with the provided key and returns the value.

The method, popitem() can be used to remove and return an arbitrary item (key, value) form the dictionary.
All the items can be removed at once using the clear() method.

We can also use the del keyword to remove individual items or the entire dictionary itself.
