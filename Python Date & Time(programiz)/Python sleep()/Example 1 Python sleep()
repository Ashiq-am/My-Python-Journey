import time

print("Printed immediately.")
time.sleep(2.4)
print("Printed after 2.4 seconds.")



Here's how this program works:

"Printed immediately" is printed
Suspends (Delays) execution for 2.4 seconds.
"Printed after 2.4 seconds" is printed.


As you can see from the above example, sleep() takes a floating-point number as an argument.




Before Python 3.5, the actual suspension time may be less than the argument specified to the time() function.

Since Python 3.5, the suspension time will be at least the seconds specified.
