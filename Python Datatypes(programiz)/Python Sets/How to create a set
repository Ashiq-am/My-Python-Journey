A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma or by using the built-in function set().

It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.).
But a set cannot have a mutable element, like list, set or dictionary, as its element.



Creating an empty set is a bit tricky.

Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary in Python.
To make a set without any elements we use the set() function without any argument.
