To specify regular expressions, metacharacters are used. In the above example, ^ and $ are metacharacters.


MetaCharacters
Metacharacters are characters that are interpreted in a special way by a RegEx engine. Here's a list of metacharacters:

[] . ^ $ * + ? {} () \ |



[] - Square brackets

Square brackets specifies a set of characters you wish to match.


Expression	                                   String	                             Matched?
	                                              a	                                 1 match
                                                 ac	                                2 matches
 [abc]                                         Hey Jude	                             No match
                                               abc de ca	                            5 matches


Here, [abc] will match if the string you are trying to match contains any of the a, b or c.

You can also specify a range of characters using - inside square brackets.

[a-e] is the same as [abcde].
[1-4] is the same as [1234].
[0-39] is the same as [01239].


You can complement (invert) the character set by using caret ^ symbol at the start of a square-bracket.

[^abc] means any character except a or b or c.
[^0-9] means any non-digit character.







(.) - Period

A period matches any single character (except newline '\n').

   ^ab	                                       abc	                                       1 match

| - Alternation

Vertical bar | is used for alternation (or operator).

Expression	                                                   String	                                        Matched?
a|b	                                                             cde	                                        No match

                                                                acdbea	                                  3 matches (at acdbea)


Here, a|b match any string that contains either a or b




() - Group

Parentheses () is used to group sub-patterns. For example,
(a|b|c)xz match any string that matches either a or b or c followed by xz

Expression	                                                  String	                                        Matched?
(a|b|c)xz	                                                  ab xz                                         	No match
                                                               abxz	                                    1 match (match at abxz)
                                                            axz cabxz	                              2 matches (at axzbc cabxz)








\ - Backslash

Backlash \ is used to escape various characters including all metacharacters. For example,

\$a match if a string contains $ followed by a. Here, $ is not interpreted by a RegEx engine in a special way.

If you are unsure if a character has special meaning or not, you can put \ in front of it.
This makes sure the character is not treated in a special way.
