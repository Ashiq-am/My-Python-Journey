We use the next() function to manually iterate through all the items of an iterator.
When we reach the end and there is no more data to be returned, it will raise StopIteration.


A more elegant way of automatically iterating is by using the for loop.
Using this, we can iterate over any object that can return an iterator, for example list, string, file etc.

>>> for element in my_list:
...     print(element)
...
