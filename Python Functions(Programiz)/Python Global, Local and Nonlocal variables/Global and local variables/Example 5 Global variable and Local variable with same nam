When we run the code, the will output be:

local x: 10
global x: 5


In above code, we used same name x for both global variable and local variable.
We get different result when we print same variable because the variable is declared in both scopes,
i.e. the local scope inside foo() and global scope outside foo().

When we print the variable inside the foo() it outputs local x: 10, this is called local scope of variable.

Similarly, when we print the variable outside the foo(), it outputs global x: 5, this is called global scope of variable.
