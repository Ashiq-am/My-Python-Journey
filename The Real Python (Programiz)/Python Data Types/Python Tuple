Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference is that tuples are immutable.
Tuples once created cannot be modified.

Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.

It is defined within parentheses () where items are separated by commas.


>>> t = (5,'program', 1+3j)




We can use the slicing operator [] to extract items but we cannot change its value.
