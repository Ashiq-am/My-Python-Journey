Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

A file containing Python code, for e.g.: example.py, is called a module and its module name would be example.

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files.
Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.

Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as example.py.



# Python Module example

def add(a, b):
   """This program adds two
   numbers and return the result"""

   result = a + b
   return result


Here, we have defined a function add() inside a module named example. The function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.
