Here, match variable contains a match object.

Our pattern (\d{3}) (\d{2}) has two subgroups (\d{3}) and (\d{2}).
You can get the part of the string of these parenthesized subgroups. Here's how:

>>> match.group(1)
'801'

>>> match.group(2)
'35'
>>> match.group(1, 2)
('801', '35')

>>> match.groups()
('801', '35')
