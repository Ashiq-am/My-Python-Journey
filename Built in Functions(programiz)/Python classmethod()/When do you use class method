1. Factory methods

Factory methods are those methods which return a class object (like constructor) for different use cases.

It is similar to function overloading in C++. Since, Python doesn't have anything as such,
class methods and static methods are used.









2. Correct instance creation in inheritance
Whenever you derive a class from implementing a factory method as a class method, it ensures correct instance creation
of the derived class.

You can create a static method for the above example but the object it creates, will always be hardcoded as Base class.

But, when you use a class method, it creates the correct instance of the derived class.
