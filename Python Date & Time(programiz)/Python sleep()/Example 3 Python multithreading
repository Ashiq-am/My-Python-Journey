All the programs above in this article are single-threaded programs.
Here's an example of a multithreaded Python program.


import threading

def print_hello_three_times():
  for i in range(3):
    print("Hello")

def print_hi_three_times():
    for i in range(3):
      print("Hi")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_hello_three_times)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_hi_three_times)

t1.start()
t2.start()



When you run the program, the output will be something like:


Hello
Hello
Hi
Hello
Hi
Hi


The above program has two threads t1 and t2. These threads are run using t1.start() and t2.start() statements.




Note that, t1 and t2 run concurrently and you might get different output.
