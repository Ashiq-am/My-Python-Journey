We can also create date objects from a timestamp.
A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds between a particular date and January 1, 1970 at UTC.
You can convert a timestamp to date using fromtimestamp() method.


from datetime import date

timestamp = date.fromtimestamp(1326244364)
print("Date =", timestamp)


When you run the program, the output will be:

Date = 2012-01-11
