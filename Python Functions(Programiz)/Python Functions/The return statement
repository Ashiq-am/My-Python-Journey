The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.


Syntax of return
return [expression_list]


This statement can contain expression which gets evaluated and the value is returned.
If there is no expression in the statement or the return statement itself is not present inside a function,
then the function will return the None object.

For example:

>>> print(greet("May"))
Hello, May. Good morning!
None

Here, None is the returned value.
