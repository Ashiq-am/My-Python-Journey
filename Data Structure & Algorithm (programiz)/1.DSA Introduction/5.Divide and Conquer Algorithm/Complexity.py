T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),
where,
n = size of input
a = number of subproblems in the recursion
n/b = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed to have the same size.
f(n) = cost of the work done outside the recursive call, which includes the cost of dividing the problem and cost of merging the solutions

For a merge sort, the equation can be written as:

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
     = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
Where, 
a = 2 (each time, a problem is divided into 2 subproblems)
n/b = n/2 (size of each sub problem is half of the input)
f(n) = time taken to divide the problem and merging the subproblems
T(n/2) = O(n log n) (To understand this, please refer to the master theorem.)

Now, T(n) = 2T(n log n) + O(n)
          ≈ O(n log n)
