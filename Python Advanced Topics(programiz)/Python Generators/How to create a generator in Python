It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function with yield statement
instead of a return statement.

If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements),
it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.

The difference is that, while a return statement terminates a function entirely,
yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.
