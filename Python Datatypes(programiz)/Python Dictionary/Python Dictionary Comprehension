Dictionary comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create new dictionary from an iterable in Python.

Dictionary comprehension consists of an expression pair (key: value) followed by for statement inside curly braces {}.

Here is an example to make a dictionary with each item being a pair of a number and its square.





This code is equivalent to

squares = {}
for x in range(6):
   squares[x] = x*x


A dictionary comprehension can optionally contain more for or if statements.

An optional if statement can filter out items to form the new dictionary.

Here are some examples to make dictionary with only odd items.
