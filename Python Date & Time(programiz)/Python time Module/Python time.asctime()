The asctime() function takes struct_time (or a tuple containing 9 elements corresponding to struct_time) as an
argument and returns a string representing it. Here's an example:

import time

t = (2018, 12, 28, 8, 44, 4, 4, 362, 0)

result = time.asctime(t)
print("Result:", result)
When you run the program, the output will be:

Result: Fri Dec 28 08:44:04 2018
