The gmtime() function takes the number of seconds passed since epoch as an argument and returns struct_time in UTC.

import time

result = time.gmtime(1545925769)
print("result:", result)
print("\nyear:", result.tm_year)
print("tm_hour:", result.tm_hour)



When you run the program, the output will be:

result = time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=28, tm_hour=8, tm_min=44, tm_sec=4, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=362, tm_isdst=0)

year = 2018
tm_hour = 8


If no argument or None is passed to gmtime(), the value returned by time() is used.
