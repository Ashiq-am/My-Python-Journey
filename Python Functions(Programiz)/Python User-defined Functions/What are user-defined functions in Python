Functions that we define ourselves to do certain specific task are referred as user-defined functions.
The way in which we define and call functions in Python are already discussed.

Functions that readily come with Python are called built-in functions.
If we use functions written by others in the form of library, it can be termed as library functions.

All the other functions that we write on our own fall under user-defined functions.
So, our user-defined function could be a library function to someone else.
