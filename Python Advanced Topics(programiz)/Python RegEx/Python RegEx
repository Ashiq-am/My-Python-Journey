A Regular Expression (RegEx) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. For example,

^a...s$


The above code defines a RegEx pattern. The pattern is: any five letter string starting with a and ending with s.

A pattern defined using RegEx can be used to match against a string.


Expression	                           String	                                Matched?

                                         abs	                                No match

                                        alias	                                 Match

^a...s$                                 abyss	                                 Match

                                        Alias	                                No match

                                      An abacus	                                No match





Python has a module named re to work with RegEx. Here's an example:



Here, we used re.match() function to search pattern within the test_string.
The method returns a match object if the search is successful. If not, it returns None.

There are other several functions defined in the re module to work with RegEx.
Before we explore that, let's learn about regular expressions themselves.
