Docstring is short for documentation string.

It is a string that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.
We must write what a function/class does in the docstring.

Triple quotes are used while writing docstrings. For example:






Docstring is available to us as the attribute __doc__ of the function.

>>> print(double.__doc__)
