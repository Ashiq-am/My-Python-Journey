There is a lot of overhead in building an iterator in Python; we have to implement a class with __iter__() and __next__() method,
keep track of internal states, raise StopIteration when there was no values to be returned etc.

This is both lengthy and counter intuitive. Generator comes into rescue in such situations.

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators.
All the overhead we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.

Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).
