Integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers falls under Python numbers category.
They are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and the isinstance() function
to check if an object belongs to a particular class.










Integers can be of any length, it is only limited by the memory available.

A floating point number is accurate up to 15 decimal places. Integer and floating points are separated by decimal points.
1 is integer, 1.0 is floating point number.

Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part. Here are some examples.






>>> a = 1234567890123456789
>>> a
1234567890123456789
>>> b = 0.1234567890123456789
>>> b
0.12345678901234568
>>> c = 1+2j
>>> c
(1+2j)


Notice that the float variable b got truncated.
