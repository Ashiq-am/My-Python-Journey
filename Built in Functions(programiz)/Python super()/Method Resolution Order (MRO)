Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which methods should be inherited in the presence of multiple inheritance.
You can view the MRO by using the __mro__ attribute.

>>> Dog.__mro__
(<class 'Dog'>,
<class 'NonMarineMammal'>,
<class 'NonWingedMammal'>,
<class 'Mammal'>,
<class 'Animal'>,
<class 'object'>)
Here is how MRO works:


A method in the derived calls is always called before the method of the base class.
In our example, Dog class is called before NonMarineMammal or NoneWingedMammal.

These two classes are called before Mammal, which is called before Animal, and Animal class is called before the object.

If there are multiple parents like Dog(NonMarineMammal, NonWingedMammal), methods of NonMarineMammal
is invoked first because it appears first.
