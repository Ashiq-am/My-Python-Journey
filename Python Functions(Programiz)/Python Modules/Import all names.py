#We imported all the definitions from the math module. This makes all names except those beginnig with an underscore,
# visible in our scope.

#Importing everything with the asterisk (*) symbol is not a good programming practice.
# This can lead to duplicate definitions for an identifier. It also hampers the readability of our code.
