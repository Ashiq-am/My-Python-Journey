Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }.
Items in a set are not ordered.








We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets. Set have unique values. They eliminate duplicates.

>>> a = {1,2,2,3,3,3}
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}



Since, set are unordered collection, indexing has no meaning. Hence the slicing operator [] does not work.



>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> a[1]
