List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible.
All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets [ ].

>>> a = [1, 2.2, 'python']


We can use the slicing operator [ ] to extract an item or a range of items from a list. Index starts form 0 in Python.
