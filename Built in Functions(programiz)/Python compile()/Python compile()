The compile() method returns a Python code object from the source (normal string, a byte string, or an AST object).

The syntax of compile() is:

compile(source, filename, mode, flags=0, dont_inherit=False, optimize=-1)






The compile() method is used if the Python code is in string form or is an AST object, and you want to change it to a code object.

The code object returned by the compile() method can later be called using methods like:
exec() and eval() which will execute dynamically generated Python code.









compile() Parameters

source - a normal string, a byte string, or an AST object

filename - file from which the code was read. If it wasn't read from a file, you can give a name yourself

mode - Either exec or eval or single.

eval - accepts only a single expression.

exec - It can take a code block that has Python statements, class and functions and so on.

single - if it consists of a single interactive statement

flags (optional) and dont_inherit (optional) - controls which future statements affect the compilation of the source.
Default Value: 0

optimize (optional) - optimization level of the compiler. Default value -1.
