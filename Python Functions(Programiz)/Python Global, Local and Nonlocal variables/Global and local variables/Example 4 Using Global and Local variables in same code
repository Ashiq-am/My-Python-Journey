When we run the code, the will output be:

global global
local

In the above code, we declare x as a global and y as a local variable in the foo().
Then, we use multiplication operator * to modify the global variable x and we print both x and y.

After calling the foo(), the value of x becomes global global because we used the x * 2 to print two times global.
After that, we print the value of local variable y i.e local.
