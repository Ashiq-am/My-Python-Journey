In the second max() function, we have passed a lambda function to the key parameter.

key = lambda k: square[k]


The function returns the values of dictionaries. Based on the values (rather than the dictionary's keys),
the key having the maximum value is returned.

Few Notes:

If we pass an empty iterator, a ValueError exception is raised. To avoid this, we can pass the default parameter.

If we pass more than one iterators, the largest item from the given iterators is returned.
