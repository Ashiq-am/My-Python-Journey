Symmetric Difference of A and B is a set of elements in both A and B except those that are common in both.

Symmetric difference is performed using ^ operator. Same can be accomplished using the method symmetric_difference().






Try the following examples on Python shell.


# use symmetric_difference function on A
>>> A.symmetric_difference(B)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

# use symmetric_difference function on B
>>> B.symmetric_difference(A)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
